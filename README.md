get distance matrix from bing maps api

Currently I am working on a inventory routing distribution problem based on machine learning driven demand forecasts.

To fetch the driving distances between n start points and m destinations, I am using the distance matrix API of Bing Maps.

with this script, you can fetch up to 50x50 distance matrix with a restfull request.
